//! Types for the army-list importer.
//!
//! Two layers live here:
//! - The **output** types ([`Roster`] and friends) mirror
//!   `schemas/core/roster.schema.json` field-for-field. They are hand-authored
//!   rather than codegen'd so importer work isn't gated on the schema→typify
//!   round-trip; the JSON Schema stays the conformance oracle (an integration
//!   test validates serialized output against it).
//! - The **intermediate** type ([`ParsedRoster`]) is format-agnostic: a
//!   [`FormatAdapter`](super::FormatAdapter) lowers a source payload to this
//!   shape (raw names + counts only, no resolved ids), and
//!   [`resolve`](super::resolve) turns it into a [`Roster`].
//!
//! Nothing here ever carries reproduced rules or ability text — only permitted
//! facts (names, counts, points, keywords, entity ids).
