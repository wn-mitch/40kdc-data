"""Card-driven secondary-mission scoring, 10th-edition tactical model.

Drawn secondaries are *held* in hand across rounds and **scored once**: the
player asserts which of a card's awards they achieved, the engine computes
the VP (clamped to the card's cap), records it against the current battle
round, and the card is then discarded.

Deck-level rules the card schema deliberately omits live here as constants —
chiefly the 5 VP-per-card ceiling of the Tactical approach. The Fixed
approach instead uses each award's printed ``vp_max``.

``PlayerGame`` is a plain JSON-serializable dict.

CONFORMANCE: mirrors ``tools/src/scoring/index.ts`` and the Rust
``wh40kdc::scoring`` module, pinned by the ``conformance/scoring`` corpus.
All values are exact integers — no tolerance.
