"""Army-list importer: decode → parse → resolve.

The adapter seam lets every supported source format plug in here without
touching ``decode`` or ``resolve``. Adapters are registered in priority
order, and every adapter's ``matches()`` predicate is tight enough that **at
most one** matches any given decoded payload — :func:`try_import_roster`
relies on that disjointness to short-circuit on the first match.

Python mirror of ``tools/src/import/import-roster.ts``. (The package is
named ``imports`` because ``import`` is a Python keyword.)
