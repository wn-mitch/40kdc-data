"""The format-adapter seam.

Each supported source format implements :class:`FormatAdapter`: it recognises
a decoded payload (``matches``) and lowers it to the format-agnostic
``ParsedRoster`` dict (``parse``). Resolution onto 40kdc entity ids happens
once, downstream, against any ``ParsedRoster`` — so adding a new source
format means writing one adapter, not touching the resolver.

Python mirror of ``tools/src/import/adapter.ts``.
