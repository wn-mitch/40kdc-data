"""Walks the dataset for every ability that could apply to a chosen unit in a
chosen phase.

Resolution order — stable for snapshot tests:

1. **army** — faction-scoped abilities whose ``ability_type`` is ``"faction"``.
2. **detachment** — abilities authored against the detachment.
3. **detachment-stratagem** — stratagems on the detachment, each yielding the
   ability referenced by ``stratagem.ability_id`` (if any).
4. **unit** — abilities listed in ``unit.ability_ids``.
5. **attached** — abilities of each attached member (pulled in full).
6. **support** — abilities on supporting units whose scope range is an aura.

Each step phase-filters via the ``Dataset.phases_for`` index.

Python mirror of ``tools/src/abilities-resolver/resolver.ts``. Entries are
dicts ``{"ability": AbilityView, "source": {...}, "phases": [...]}``; the
corpus compares ability-id sets per source kind.
