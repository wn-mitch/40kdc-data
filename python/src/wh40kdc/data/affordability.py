"""candidate_affordability — given the units already in a list and a points
budget, price the cheapest next copy of each candidate unit and flag whether it
still fits. Powers the list-builder's "sort cheapest-first / grey out the
unaffordable" catalog affordance, and is exposed as a cross-impl primitive so
the maths is pinned by ``conformance/affordability/``.

The cost of "one more copy" is ordinal-aware: 11e prices some datasheets by army
ordinal (see :func:`base_unit_points`), so the next copy of a datasheet you
already field twice may cost more than the first. ``nextCopyCost`` is the
cheapest *entry point* — the minimum over the unit's points tiers of
``base_unit_points(unit, tier.models, next_ordinal)`` — i.e. taking it at its
smallest legal size, at the ordinal it would enter the army.
