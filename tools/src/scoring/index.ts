/**
 * Card-driven secondary-mission scoring, 10th-edition tactical model.
 *
 * Drawn secondaries are *held* in hand across rounds and **scored once**: the
 * player asserts which of a card's awards they achieved, the engine computes the
 * VP (clamped to the card's cap), records it against the current battle round,
 * and the card is then discarded. There is no multi-turn per-card accrual — a
 * card pays out exactly once.
 *
 * Why "asserted" rather than evaluated: there is no board-state model here, so
 * an award's `when` condition is a human-readable label (see
 * `translate/scoring.ts`'s `describeScoringCard`, which this module never
 * modifies), not something the engine checks. The player ticks the awards they
 * made; the engine does the arithmetic, the OR-tier resolution, the cumulative
 * sums, and the cap.
 *
 * Deck-level rules the card schema deliberately omits live here as constants —
 * chiefly the 5 VP-per-card ceiling of the Tactical approach. The Fixed approach
 * instead uses each award's printed `vp_max`.
 *
 * `PlayerGame` is a plain JSON-serializable object so a UI can persist a whole
 * match (two of them) to localStorage and rehydrate without a revival step.
 *
 * CONFORMANCE FOLLOW-UP: this engine is TypeScript-only for now. A Rust port
 * plus a `conformance/scoring` corpus area (and a `SPEC_VERSION` bump) are a
 * separate change; the public shapes below are the surface that port mirrors,
 * so keep them stable.
