/**
 * DSL stub authoring engine (#21) — batched, subscription-billed, two-phase.
 *
 * Empty-modifier ability stubs (`{type:"stat-modifier", modifier:{}}` and kin)
 * are authored into real DSL from their 10e-archive source rule. The work is a
 * pile of discrete, stateless, structured LLM calls, so we run them as batched
 * `claude -p --json-schema` invocations on the Claude subscription rather than
 * spawning a full agent per ability (the agent fan-out's per-call system-prompt
 * + tool-loop overhead is ~50-100x the useful work). Assembly and schema
 * validation are pure TS — the model only classifies and judges.
 *
 *   author-input/<faction>.json  (datasheet-resolved rules, from author-input.ts)
 *     ── classify ──▶  flat slot-forms        (batched claude -p)
 *     ── assemble ──▶  full ability entries    (TS: effect + scope, no LLM)
 *     ── validate ──▶  AJV against the schema   (TS — rejects invented enums)
 *     ── verify  ──▶  fidelity verdict          (batched claude -p, scope-aware)
 *     ─────────────▶  data/_audit/proposed/<faction>.json
 *
 * Two modes:
 *   propose  (default) — write proposals; never touch live data.
 *   apply              — splice gated proposals into live abilities.json. Only
 *                        rewrites entries that are STILL empty-modifier stubs,
 *                        so re-running is safe and authored work is never
 *                        clobbered. Gate defaults: schema-valid + verifier-
 *                        faithful + confidence≠low + not complex-flagged.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx tools/src/author-batch.ts propose <faction|--all> [--batch N] [--model M]
 *   npx tsx tools/src/author-batch.ts apply   <faction|--all> [--min-confidence high|medium]
 *                                                              [--include-complex] [--dry-run]
