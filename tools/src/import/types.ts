/**
 * Types for the army-list importer.
 *
 * Two layers live here:
 * - The **output** types ({@link Roster} and friends) mirror
 *   `schemas/core/roster.schema.json` field-for-field. They are hand-authored
 *   rather than generated so importer work isn't gated on the Rust→typify codegen
 *   round-trip; the AJV validator (against the real schema) is the source of truth
 *   for conformance.
 * - The **intermediate** type ({@link ParsedRoster}) is format-agnostic: a parser
 *   adapter lowers a source payload to this shape (raw names + counts only, no
 *   resolved ids), and {@link resolve} turns it into a {@link Roster}.
 *
 * Nothing here ever carries reproduced rules or ability text — only permitted
 * facts (names, counts, points, keywords, entity ids).
