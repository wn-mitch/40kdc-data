/**
 * audit:source-digest — report Ability DSL annotations whose printed source
 * rule has drifted since the annotation was authored (#217).
 *
 * The command joins the public annotation set to a contributor-owned corpus of
 * printed rules, recomputes each rule's {@link sourceDigest}, and compares it
 * with the annotation's stored `source_digest`. It is READ-ONLY: the write path
 * is the separate `backfill:source-digest` command, because an audit must not
 * mutate tracked data.
 *
 * The corpus lives outside this repository and is only ever read. Every source
 * string is reduced to a digest by {@link parseSourceDigestCorpus} the moment it
 * is parsed, so no report row, rendered line or error message can carry prose —
 * findings are faction ids, ability ids, statuses and counts, nothing else. The
 * stored and computed digests are compared but never emitted either: a digest
 * is a fingerprint of the rule, and there is no reason for a public log to
 * carry one.
 *
 * It is a standalone `tsx` script rather than a `40kdc-validate` subcommand or
 * a `just preflight` step: its input is contributor-owned and absent from the
 * repository and from CI, so wiring it into either would break every
 * environment that does not have the corpus.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run audit:source-digest -- <corpus.json> [--root <repo-root>]
 *
 * Exit status: `1` when any finding exists (`changed`, `untracked`,
 * `missing-source` or `unknown-source`) or when the input is malformed;
 * `0` only when every scanned annotation joined to a corpus entry and every
 * digest matched.
 *
