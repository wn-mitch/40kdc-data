# MFM stratagems — APPLIED

APPLIED (first-class dump columns): `cp_cost` ← cpCost, `player_turn` ← key,
`type` ← category (fill-only), `category` ← detachmentId presence.
REVIEW ONLY (not written): `phases`, prose-derived — the structured
`stratagem_phase` table is a buggy index (Insane Bravery→charge, Holy
Avarice→command, Scriptural Prognosis→all-five), so authored phases win.
`timing` + `game_version` left authored.
