# Papercuts

Small repository frictions recorded while doing real work.

## 2026-08-05T17:38:48Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

A remembered .claude/skills/dsl-campaign path was absent in the current workspace, causing a parallel inspection batch to fail before returning independent results.

## 2026-08-05T19:17:02Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

jj status refused to snapshot a 39.9 MiB untracked session HTML file, adding repeated warning noise and preventing a clean workspace snapshot.

## 2026-08-05T21:39:11Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

Browser request interception did not surface EventSource stream requests, so the documented interception path could not drive staged SSE commits and required a localhost fixture server instead.

## 2026-08-05T22:07:50Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

The required killport helper is unavailable, so a failed combined-server launch could not use the mandated port cleanup command.

## 2026-08-06T00:54:08Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

Browser open waited on Vite networkidle0 and timed out because the dev UI keeps a connection open; the tab may still be usable, but the error obscures that state.

## 2026-08-06T02:42:10Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

Impeccable skill required .claude/skills/impeccable/scripts/load-context.mjs, but the prescribed project-relative path does not exist in this workspace, blocking its non-optional context loader.


## 2026-08-06T15:26:09Z — gpt-5.6-sol

Impeccable setup documents a repo-local .claude loader path, but this repository only exposes the skill through skill://, causing the prescribed command to fail before context loading.

## 2026-08-06T20:55:48Z — gpt-5.6-sol

The campaign skill and agent outputs referenced tools/src/translate/cli.ts, but that path does not exist; attempting the documented translation validation command failed before validation and required locating the current CLI.

## 2026-08-07T15:27:24Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

jq was invoked over multiple faction JSON files without slurping, producing one report per file and exiting 5 instead of one corpus-wide enum summary; use jq -s/add for this lookup.

## 2026-08-13T19:05:11Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

Running the documented jj workspace update-stale precondition rebased this workspace onto a conflicted divergent parent and surfaced dozens of unrelated conflicts, blocking safe implementation until workspace lineage is reconciled.

## 2026-08-13T19:50:33Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

A one-off Python text replacement against a truncated long line failed because the assumed literal occurred more than once after an earlier edit; anchored file edits are safer for long generated-style workflow lines.

## 2026-08-13T20:28:59Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

Root just preflight invokes system pip install and fails under Homebrew's PEP 668 externally-managed environment instead of using the repository virtualenv, blocking the documented gate after artifact regeneration.

## 2026-08-13T23:32:19Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

A jq schema-introspection query failed on a parenthesis error while enumerating effect wrapper child fields, adding an avoidable discovery round trip; use a simpler staged jq expression for nested  checks.

## 2026-08-14T15:49:00Z — gpt-5.6-sol

The extant claim importer timed out after an hour because every nested event rebuilt all node ability references; bulk graph transactions need one deferred reference rebuild at commit.

## 2026-08-14T18:57:39Z — gpt-5.6-sol

Live schema-five claim migration with candidate import exceeded the one-hour command timeout; candidate persistence is too slow for the 40k corpus and needs batching or indexing before retry.

## 2026-08-15T18:31:17Z — gpt-5.6-sol

The OMP Eval JavaScript runtime could not import the campaign GraphStore because Bun cannot resolve Node 22's node:sqlite module, so graph-backed workflow helpers cannot run directly in Eval despite the workflow scripts being JavaScript.

## 2026-08-15T19:25:38Z — gpt-5.6-sol

The installed jq-compatible CLI rejects the standard input_filename filter, so multi-file JSON diagnostics cannot label source files as expected; this forced a separate file-enumeration step.

## 2026-08-15T22:20:19Z — gpt-5.6-sol

The graph-backed verification workflow serializes a long skitarius gate before six review agents; the 30-minute subagent cap terminated the driver and subsequent agent calls hit the usage limit, leaving later request files unresolved. Long mechanical gates should run outside the model call or in a separately resumable wave.

## 2026-08-15T22:46:32Z — gpt-5.6-sol

tooling/parity/differ.py prefers an existing stale target/release runner over a freshly rebuilt target/debug runner, producing false cross-port divergences and an old version report. The CLI should detect freshness/version or prefer an explicitly rebuilt debug binary during local iteration.

## 2026-08-15T22:58:52Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

Fresh Go runner build from the repository root failed because the Go module lives under go/. Use 'go -C go build' for parity runner rebuilds.

## 2026-08-15T23:01:09Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

The Bun-backed JS eval cannot import the graph runtime because it depends on Node's built-in node:sqlite module. Campaign lifecycle repairs therefore require a temporary Node script or a graph CLI command.

## 2026-08-15T23:12:11Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

gh pr create in the jj workspace failed because the workspace has no .git directory. Pass --repo explicitly when opening PRs from /Users/will.mitchell/40kdc-dsl.

## 2026-08-20T19:13:10Z — gpt-5.6

The Codex workspace ran out of disk space during a JSON write because a 335 MB OCR orientation scratch directory remained under /tmp; the failed write had to be verified before retrying after cleanup.

## 2026-08-20T22:37:07Z — gpt-5.6-sol

The pack extractor resolves PDF and store arguments against the repository root even when invoked from tools; passing ../_private from the tools cwd escaped the repo and failed before extraction.

## 2026-08-20T22:51:02Z — gpt-5.6-sol

python/.venv is editable-installed against /private/tmp/40kdc-maps-ci-fix rather than this workspace, so focused pytest silently exercised stale source until PYTHONPATH=python/src was set.

## 2026-08-20T22:57:16Z — gpt-5.6-sol

npm run mfm:golden silently rewrote the committed MFM 925 golden and gaps from the local stale data_version 895 dump; the command needs a downgrade guard before writing.

## 2026-08-21T00:00:39Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

author:ingest resolves manifest paths from tools/ despite AGENTS.md saying tool path args resolve from the repo root; a documented repo-relative _private/manifests path was reported missing.

## 2026-08-21T00:17:58Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

AGENTS.md documents an upstream remote for 40kdc-data, but this workspace has no upstream remote;  fails and the actual canonical remote must be inferred from repository metadata.

## 2026-08-21T00:37:55Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

The advertised silent-failure-hunter and pr-test-analyzer agents failed immediately with 'No model selected', so their review slices could not run.

## 2026-08-21T04:19:52Z — codex

author:input hard-fails when the optional ~/army-assist checkout is absent, even though the sibling raw-text store already contains the required rules; this blocks refreshing source-grounded repair inputs.

## 2026-08-21T14:07:44Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

tsx -e could not resolve a local TypeScript module imported with a .js suffix, despite repository source imports using extensionless TypeScript paths; the validation one-liner failed before execution.

## 2026-08-21T14:10:07Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

Codex raw-store records can carry phases: null despite phase comparison code expecting arrays; jq phase audits must normalize with // [].

## 2026-08-21T14:30:08Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

The new just regen recipe attempted a global editable pip install on macOS and failed under PEP 668, blocking preflight despite all Python tooling already being installed. Regeneration should not mutate the package environment.

## 2026-08-21T16:30:16Z — gpt-5.6-sol

Temporary model-adapter PATH omitted the active NVM bin, so npm failed before running; prepend /tmp to the inherited PATH instead.

## 2026-08-21T16:47:45Z — gpt-5.6-sol

The raw-text store's verification script writes a 4.9 MiB unignored dist/bundle-abilities.json, which jj refuses to snapshot; verification requires manually deleting this transient output.

## 2026-08-21T16:57:34Z — gpt-5.6-sol

gh cannot infer a repository from a colocated jj workspace that lacks a .git directory; raw-store PR commands must pass the explicit -R repository.

## 2026-08-28T15:11:14Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

A live Battlemaster re-projection strips committed keystones, but the documented derive-keystones --rederive follow-up now fails on a 0.5-inch pairing difference in bm-disrupt-vs-disrupt-01, preventing the projected data from being restored.

## 2026-08-28T16:19:22Z — openai-codex

The layout-editor workspace has no local Prettier binary, so its ordinary npx prettier command fails; formatting must be invoked through the root tools workspace.

## 2026-08-28T16:29:49Z — openai-codex

The layout-editor production build emitted its bundle-size table but then hung until the 10-minute command timeout while a persistent Vite dev server was running; the same build normally exits in seconds.

## 2026-09-03T19:08:57Z — codex

Phase 5 names the audit as npx tsx tools/src/audit-loadout-coverage.ts, but I reflexively ran the tools-only npm script from the repository root; npm failed before regeneration and made no project changes.

## 2026-09-03T19:18:39Z — codex

I ran a jq probe with a literal TARGET placeholder instead of first extracting the BSData target id; it returned an empty result and provided no diagnostic value.

## 2026-09-03T19:23:34Z — codex

This installed jj version has no archive subcommand, so the planned whole-parent materialization failed before comparison; use jj file show per composition instead.
<<<<<<< conflict 1 of 1
+++++++ qotqmzzv 02ae2248 "chore: Release 1.4.3" (rebase destination)

## 2026-09-08T16:37:21Z — gpt-6-astra

The supplied review appeared only as truncated inline text, with no recoverable attachment URI. Earlier local exports were different reviews, so the full finding inventory requires the original Markdown upload.

## 2026-09-08T16:49:20Z — gpt-6-astra

The CLI rejects --list-models; model availability is exposed by omp models find, while pi/task must first be resolved through omp config get modelRoles.

## 2026-09-08T18:08:23Z — gpt-6-astra

Eval's edit bridge takes an undocumented input field and returns hasError instead of throwing; unchecked calls left an intended edit unapplied. The bash wildcard expansion also emitted nonexistent suffix paths rather than matching full paths.

## 2026-09-08T19:03:03Z — gpt-6-astra

Runner protocol documentation showed init fields at top level, but the actual runner requires args; corrected the example. Rust codegen also requires refreshing the schema bundle first, and its flattener accepts only whole-file or top-level definition references.

## 2026-09-08T19:18:01Z — gpt-6-astra

Rust loadout coverage is not a standalone integration target; cargo test --test loadout fails. Use cargo test -p wh40kdc loadout to select the embedded and API tests.

## 2026-09-08T20:51:05Z — gpt-6-astra

A subagent reported private JSON proposal paths that were absent from the parent workspace. Recovering and publishing the existing artifacts required a second handoff before validation could run.

## 2026-09-10T14:09:16Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

A jj log query failed because GitHub exposed an external-fork PR SHA that the local jj repo had not fetched. Check ref availability or add the contributor remote before including external PR SHAs in one revision set.

## 2026-09-10T14:19:43Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

A PR data-review subagent ran to completion but yielded null data, so the canonical data and stock-loadout audit had to be dispatched again.

## 2026-09-15T00:05:56Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

ast_edit matched all faction JSON properties but proposed invalid arrays by stripping captured string quotes, forcing a parsed JSON codemod fallback.

## 2026-09-15T00:13:12Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

just preflight fails by design on intended uncommitted generated artifacts, so it cannot serve as a pre-commit gate for schema changes; use verify-regen-stable plus test-all before committing, then preflight.

## 2026-09-15T00:17:01Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

Example-local npm test and check failed because workspace dependencies were absent; the repository requires npm ci at the monorepo root before example validation.

## 2026-09-15T00:30:03Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

gh pr merge failed in a jj detached working copy because it tried to determine a current git branch; pass -R owner/repo so the operation does not depend on checkout state.

## 2026-09-15T00:55:38Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

Local npm credentials are unavailable, so accidental release cleanup must run through the authenticated GitHub Actions publish environment.

## 2026-09-15T20:01:25Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

A shell glob for optional per-faction artifacts expanded through every data/core child, causing cp to report dozens of expected missing paths after copying valid files. Use an explicit file list or nullglob-capable invocation for heterogeneous trees.

## 2026-09-15T20:04:36Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

Running npm test from tools with the repository-relative tools/test path made Vitest find no files because its root is already tools/. Use test/validate.test.ts or validate.test.ts from that workspace.

## 2026-09-15T20:09:55Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

npm pack --dry-run --json interleaves prepack lifecycle output with JSON, so piping directly to jq fails and closes stdout, causing the postbuild audit to crash with EPIPE. Run prepack prerequisites separately and use --ignore-scripts for machine-readable inspection.

## 2026-09-16T18:32:13Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

The browser tab.run context exposes Puppeteer, not Playwright: page.locator(...).count() is unavailable despite locator-style APIs being common elsewhere. Use page.99520eval/querySelectorAll for DOM counts.

## 2026-08-25T21:00:09Z — gpt-5.6
The persistent Bun eval kernel cannot import node:sqlite, so graph workflow smoke tests require a separate Node invocation despite the workflow's Node runtime.
