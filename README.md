> **Looking for 10th edition data?** The 10e dataset is preserved on branch [`10e-archive`](https://github.com/wn-mitch/40kdc-data/tree/10e-archive) and tagged [`10th/2025-q3`](https://github.com/wn-mitch/40kdc-data/releases/tag/10th/2025-q3). The `main` branch is migrating to **11th edition** — see [`11e-migration.md`](11e-migration.md) for status and the work plan.

Community-owned data schemas for Warhammer 40,000 developer tooling — **and** a linked, typed API over the dataset they describe.

## What This Is

Two things, both community-owned:

1. **The schema layer** for the [40kdc](https://40kdc.alpacasoft.dev) ecosystem — JSON Schemas that model 40K entities so tools can exchange data. Entity IDs are the interoperability contract.
2. **A ready-to-use dataset package.** The whole dataset ships embedded behind an intuitive, typed API: find a unit, then walk to its weapons, abilities, the phases those abilities act in, and its faction — no database, no network, no runtime filesystem access. Same ergonomics consumers expect, available today.

```ts
import { units } from "@alpaca-software/40kdc-data";

units.find("Kharn")!.abilities
  .filter(a => a.phases.includes("fight"))
  .map(a => a.id); // ["legendary-killer", "berzerker-frenzy"]
```

`find` is diacritic- and punctuation-insensitive — 40K is played globally, so `find("Kharn")` resolves "Khârn the Betrayer" and `find("Belakor")` resolves "Be'lakor". Full API reference: [`tools/docs/api/`](tools/docs/api/README.md).

## What This Is Not

This is not a database of game rules. Ability text is never stored here — it's replaced by the [Ability DSL](#ability-dsl), a community-authored structured language that expresses what abilities *do* without reproducing copyrighted text.

Stat lines and point costs are included. These are numerical facts, not creative expression.

## IP Stance

| Content | Included? | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Stat lines (M, T, W, Sv, etc.) | Yes | Numerical facts |
| Point costs | Yes | Numerical facts |
| Weapon stats (A, S, AP, D) | Yes | Numerical facts |
| Ability text | **No** | Creative expression — replaced by DSL |
| Rules text | **No** | Creative expression |
| Artwork / logos | **No** | Creative IP |

## Quick Start

Use the dataset (TypeScript / JavaScript):

```bash
npm install @alpaca-software/40kdc-data
```

```ts
import { units, factions } from "@alpaca-software/40kdc-data";

const kharn = units.find("Kharn");
kharn?.faction?.id;            // "world-eaters"
kharn?.weapons.map(w => w.name);
factions.find("World Eaters")?.units.length;
```

See [`tools/README.md`](tools/README.md) for the full collection/link reference.

Validate data against schemas (the package also ships an AJV validator + CLI):

```bash
cd tools
npm install
npm run validate           # all data
npm run validate:core      # or just core / enrichment
npm run validate:enrichment
```

The package also ships a `40kdc-runner` binary that implements the
language-agnostic [conformance runner protocol](conformance/RUNNER_PROTOCOL.md):
NDJSON requests on stdin, NDJSON responses on stdout. The cross-implementation
parity differ uses this to compare every port against the same corpus. It is
not the recommended way to use the library — import the package directly for
that — but it is the supported entry point for cross-language verification.

## Schemas

### Core (structural entities)

| Schema | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [faction](schemas/core/faction.schema.json) | Playable factions and sub-factions |
| [unit](schemas/core/unit.schema.json) | Unit datasheets with stat profiles and points |
| [weapon](schemas/core/weapon.schema.json) | Weapons with stat lines |
| [game-version](schemas/core/game-version.schema.json) | Edition and dataslate tracking |

### Enrichment (community-authored intelligence)

| Schema | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [phase-mapping](schemas/enrichment/phase-mapping.schema.json) | Maps abilities to game phases |
| [timing-flag](schemas/enrichment/timing-flag.schema.json) | Precise within-phase timing |
| [interaction-flag](schemas/enrichment/interaction-flag.schema.json) | Ability conflicts, combos, sequencing |
| [ability](schemas/enrichment/ability-dsl/ability.schema.json) | Structured ability definitions (DSL) |

### Shared Definitions

| Schema | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [common](schemas/$defs/common.schema.json) | Entity IDs, keywords, stat values |
| [game-version-ref](schemas/$defs/game-version-ref.schema.json) | Edition + dataslate reference |

## Ability DSL

Instead of storing ability text, 40kdc builds structured game trees that express what abilities *do*. Game mechanics aren't copyrightable — only their expression is. The DSL is a new expression authored by the community.

An ability entry composes four primitives:

- **Trigger**: when it activates (phase, timing, type)
- **Condition**: prerequisites (recursive AND/OR/NOT tree)
- **Effect**: what it does (stat modifiers, re-rolls, mortal wounds, etc.)
- **Scope**: targeting range and duration

Effects support composition: `choice` (pick one of N) and `sequence` (ordered steps).

See [schemas/enrichment/ability-dsl/](schemas/enrichment/ability-dsl/) and [data/enrichment/_example/abilities.example.json](data/enrichment/_example/abilities.example.json) for examples.

## Versioning

Everything is tagged to edition + dataslate (e.g., `11th/2025-q3`). See [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md).

## For Tool Developers

Multiple ways to consume this repo, depending on language and use case.

**The data package** — `npm install @alpaca-software/40kdc-data` for the embedded
dataset behind the linked typed API (above), plus the generated entity types and
an AJV validator. This is the fastest path for most tools.

**The schemas directly** — for non-JS toolchains or custom pipelines:

1. Add `40kdc-data` as a git submodule, or reference schema `$id` URLs
2. Point your JSON Schema validator (draft 2020-12) at `schemas/`
3. Use entity IDs from the 40kdc dataset for interoperability

### Rust

The `wh40kdc` crate exposes serde-deserializable structs generated from these
schemas (one flat module, regenerated by `cargo run -p xtask -- codegen`). Until
it publishes to crates.io, depend on it via git:

```toml
[dependencies]
wh40kdc = { git = "https://github.com/wn-mitch/40kdc-data" }
```

```rust
use wh40kdc::Unit;

let units: Vec<Unit> = serde_json::from_str(&json)?;
```

The crate also bundles the schema as `wh40kdc::BUNDLED_SCHEMA` for downstream
validation. The crate also ships a `wh40kdc-runner` binary used by the
cross-implementation parity differ — see [`CONFORMANCE.md`](CONFORMANCE.md).
Crate types are MIT; the schema content they describe is CC0.

### Python

The [`wh40kdc`](python/) package on PyPI mirrors the TypeScript API surface:
Dataset linked queries, importers and exporters for all roster formats, the
damage-projection cruncher and attribution, the abilities resolver, scoring,
terrain geometry, the DSL/scoring describers, and a schema validator emitting
the shared closed-enum error codes.

```bash
pip install wh40kdc
```

```python
from wh40kdc import Dataset

ds = Dataset.embedded()
unit = ds.units.find("Khârn the Betrayer")
print([w.name for w in unit.weapons])
```

Entities are plain dicts (mirroring the JSON the schemas describe) behind
linked views; generated `TypedDict`s in `wh40kdc._types` provide static
typing. The only runtime dependency is `jsonschema`. The package also ships
the conformance runner (`python -m wh40kdc.runner`) used by the
cross-implementation parity differ — see [`CONFORMANCE.md`](CONFORMANCE.md).
Package code is MIT; the schema content it describes is CC0.

### R *(planned)*

An R package is planned, likely as an `extendr` wrapper around the Rust crate
rather than a native port (the Rust ecosystem handles cruncher numerics and JSON
parity more cleanly than R's idioms allow at the boundary). The decision is
pending a wrapper prototype; the [`CONFORMANCE.md`](CONFORMANCE.md) FAQ explains
the trade-off in more detail.

### Parity guarantee

All official ports — TypeScript, Rust, and the planned Python and R packages —
are held in behavioral agreement by a shared conformance corpus in
[`conformance/`](conformance/). Within the documented tolerances (notably
`±5e-4` per cruncher stage; byte-equal export goldens otherwise), the same
inputs produce the same outputs in every language. See [`CONFORMANCE.md`](CONFORMANCE.md)
for what's pinned, the per-area invariants, and the contribution rules.
